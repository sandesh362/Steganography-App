🖼️ Steganography App 🔐
Welcome to the Steganography App, a powerful Java-based application that allows you to hide and reveal secret messages within images using AES encryption! Secure your communication through image encoding and decoding, all wrapped in a sleek, user-friendly interface. 🎨🔒

✨ Features
🔑 AES Encryption: Ensure top-tier security with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), allowing secure encoding of your secret messages.
📷 Message Encoding: Embed encrypted messages into your selected images seamlessly.
🔍 Message Decoding: Extract and decrypt hidden messages from images with ease.
🌑 Dark-Themed UI: Enjoy a modern, visually appealing interface with smooth controls and enhanced usability.
💬 User-Friendly Input: Input your private key and message effortlessly for a secure and simple steganography experience.
⚙️ How It Works
🖼️ Select an Image: Choose any image from your local system.
✍️ Enter a Message: Type your secret message in the provided text area.
🔒 Set a Private Key: Input a private key for encryption and decryption purposes.
🛠️ Encode: Hide the encrypted message within the image.
🧩 Decode: Retrieve and decrypt hidden messages from the image using the same private key.
💻 Installation
